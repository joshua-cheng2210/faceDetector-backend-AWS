# learnings
- building the backend to connect from the frontend through server.js
- connecting to the DB set up through render.com from the server.js and respond to the frontend
- server.js
    - receiving and responging http requests through (req, res) => {} 
    - using postman to test the backend connection for development process
- database
    - using pgAdmin to manage the DB
    - using knex for DB migrations (for interacting with the DB)
    - using bcrypt for hashing passwords
    - using cors to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend
    - using express to set up the server and handle routing
- hosting through render.com
    - setting up the backend hosting

        - through creating a docker image for scalaility
        - using render's environmental variables to set up the DB connection. and using process.env to access the environmental variables in my server.js
    - setting up the DB hosting
        - https://dashboard.render.com/d/dpg-d0md2hmmcj7s739757fg-a/info
        - using knex for DB migrations (for interacting with the DB)
        - using pgAdmin for DB management UI or visualizing the DB
- Docker
    - building and image 
    - pushing the image to docker hub repo
    - figuring out the individual ports needed for the frontend docker, frontend docker hosting, backend docker, backend DB
- update the backend to be hosted through AWS
    - uploaded these files and directories to the AWS S3 bucket:
        - package.json
        - index.js
    - deploy this code form s3 bucket to AWS Lambda
    - delete the code from teh s3 bucket (because it is not needed anymore)
    - used the api gateway to create an endpoint for the lambda function (and then used this endpoint in the frontend code)
    
# sql tables
CREATE TABLE login (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    hash VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    entries BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

# for future developments deployments:
- docker build -t facedetector-backend .
- docker tag facedetector-backend:latest joshua2210/facedetector-backend:latest
- docker push joshua2210/facedetector-backend:latest
- or do this one liner command:
```bash
docker build -t facedetector-backend .  ;docker tag facedetector-backend:latest joshua2210/facedetector-backend:latest;docker push joshua2210/facedetector-backend:latest;
```
- go to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d0mcv70gjchc738eb1s0/deploys/dep-d0mj8hbuibrs73eojftg
- click Manual deploy >> deploy latest reference

# future development ideas:
- implement some data colections
- introduce more Clarifai models too (not just face detection)
- look into some security protection for the backend (look into the cors policy instead of using "*" and sql injection prevention)
- have osme CI/CD pipelining for the backend and frontend (maybe use github actions)
- maybe host through AWS or GCP
- Input Validation: Implement more thorough server-side validation for all incoming data (e.g., using a library like Joi or express-validator) beyond basic checks.
- write some unit test fo the backend and run these tests in the CI/CD pipeline
